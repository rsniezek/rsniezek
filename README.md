### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my profile. If you want to find out more about me or the things I work on, please visit my website: [sniegu.dev](https://sniegu.dev)

Professionally, I am Embedded Software Architect at Nokia where I work mainly on the Networking part of our Linux distribution, both in userspace and kernelspace.

Personally, I am huge Linux and C++ nerd, like to learn as much as I can. I'm thinking about starting a learning project where I would create a simple game engine as gamedev was always at the back of my mind.

Currenlty, I'm learning about Nix, both as a language and a package manager. It's a great tool for developers as creating isolated, ad-hoc development environment is probably the easiest thing there is with Nix.
